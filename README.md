# signal_denoising_recovery# Signal Denoising and Recovery with CUDA

## Overview
This project removes noise from signals and recovers the clean signal using CUDA for efficient processing.

## Dataset
You can use any noisy signal data for processing. An example signal, `noisy_signal.csv`, is provided in the `data/` directory.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/signal_denoising_recovery.git
   cd signal_denoising_recovery
